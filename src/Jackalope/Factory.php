 * It is injected in the constructor of every class of the framework.
 *
 * It should be used in the code like that:
 * $this->factory->get('Node', array(...));
 * $this->factory->get('NodeType\PropertyDefinition', array(...));
 * //note the \ for sub namespaces. the name is relative to the jackalope namespace
 *
 * The result will be an object from jackalope with the given named params.
 *
 * Note that the factory passes itself to every object it creates, to give them
 * a reference to itselves.
